# XML (Extensible Markup Language) 

is used in web development for various purposes, including:

- **Data Storage and Transfer:** XML is commonly used to store and transport data between systems, especially in web services and APIs.

- **Configuration Files:** Many web applications and frameworks use XML for configuration settings (e.g., Spring Framework in Java, .NET applications).

- **Web Services (SOAP):** XML is the foundation of SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), which is used for exchanging structured information in web services.

- **RSS and Atom Feeds:** XML is used in RSS (Really Simple Syndication) and Atom feeds to structure and distribute web content like news and blog updates.

- Sitemaps: Search engines use XML sitemaps to understand the structure of a website and index its pages effectively.

- Data Exchange Between Different Technologies: XML is platform-independent, making it ideal for exchanging data between different programming languages and systems.

- SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics): XML-based SVG is used for creating vector graphics that can be scaled without losing quality.

- XHTML: An XML-based version of HTML that ensures stricter document structure and validation.

- While JSON has largely replaced XML for data exchange in modern web applications due to its simplicity and efficiency, XML is still widely used in legacy systems and specific applications.
